--------------------
This image features a raccoon perched in a tree. The raccoon's face is visible with its characteristic black mask and pointy ears accentuated by white outlines. Its fur appears dense and mixtures of grey, black, and hints of brown. The creature looks directly at the camera, conveying a sense of curiosity or alertness. The background is slightly blurred, throwing the focus onto the raccoon and allowing us to observe the detail of its fur and the sharpness of its gaze. Surrounding branches suggest the raccoon is nestled comfortably in a green, leafy environment, typical of a woodland or forest habitat where raccoons are often found.
